abstract="The super-resolution of low-resolution brain graphs, also known as brain connectomes, is a crucial aspect of neuroimaging research, especially in brain graph super-resolution. Brain graph super-resolution revolutionized neuroimaging research by eliminating the need for costly acquisition and data processing. However, the development of generative models for super-resolving brain graphs remains largely unexplored. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in this domain leverages the inherent topology of brain connectomes by employing a Graph Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) coupled with topological feature-based regularization to achieve super-resolution. However, training graph-based GANs is notoriously challenging due to issues regarding scalability and implicit probability modeling. To overcome these limitations and fully capitalize on the capabilities of generative models, we propose Dif-GSR (Diffusion based Graph Super-Resolution) for predicting high-resolution brain graphs from low-resolution ones. Diffusion models have gained significant popularity in recent years as flexible and powerful frameworks for explicitly modelling complex data distributions. Dif-GSR consists of a noising process for adding noise to brain connectomes, a conditional denoiser model which learns to conditionally remove noise with respect to an input low-resolution source connectome and a sampling module which is responsible for the generation of high-resolution brain connectomes. We evaluate Dif-GSR using three-fold cross-validation using a variety of standard metrics for brain connectome super-resolution. We present the first diffusion-based framework for brain graph super-resolution, which is trained on non-isomorphic inter-modality brain graphs, effectively handling variations in graph size, distribution, and structure. This advancement holds promising prospects for multimodal and holistic brain mapping, as well as the development of a multimodal neurological disorder diagnostic frameworks.

  abstract      = "Linguistics has been instrumental in developing a deeper
                   understanding of human nature. Words are indispensable to
                   bequeath the thoughts, emotions, and purpose of any human
                   interaction, and critically analyzing these words can
                   elucidate the social and psychological behavior and
                   characteristics of these social animals. Social media has
                   become a platform for human interaction on a large scale and
                   thus gives us scope for collecting and using that data for
                   our study. However, this entire process of collecting,
                   labeling, and analyzing this data iteratively makes the
                   entire procedure cumbersome. To make this entire process
                   easier and structured, we would like to introduce
                   TLA(Twitter Linguistic Analysis). In this paper, we describe
                   TLA and provide a basic understanding of the framework and
                   discuss the process of collecting, labeling, and analyzing
                   data from Twitter for a corpus of languages while providing
                   detailed labeled datasets for all the languages and the
                   models are trained on these datasets. The analysis provided
                   by TLA will also go a long way in understanding the
                   sentiments of different linguistic communities and come up
                   with new and innovative solutions for their problems based
                   on the analysis.",
