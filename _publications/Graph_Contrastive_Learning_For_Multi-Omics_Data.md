title: "GRAPH CONTRASTIVE LEARNING FOR MULTI-OMICS DATA"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/MOGCL
excerpt: 'This paper
studies the effects of introducing graph contrastive learning to help leverage graph structure and information
to produce better representations for downstream classification tasks for multi-omics datasets.
We present a learnining framework named Multi-Omics Graph Contrastive Learner(MOGCL) which
outperforms several aproaches for integrating multi-omics data for supervised learning tasks'
