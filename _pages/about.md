About Me
======
I am a machine learning engineer pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from K.J Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai.

My current research interests lie in the field of geometric deep learning. I have significant research experience in Natural Language Processing and Graph Neural Networks. I have previously interned at Mettler Toledo for a duration of 6 months where I implemented novel NLP algorithms and models like Microsoft's Layoutlmv2 to help automate the different workflows present at the company. I was a  research assistant at K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, where I worked on integrating remote sensing applications with deep learning technology. I have received the MITACS Globalinks research scholarship which will enable me to work as a visiting researcher at Queens University Canada for a duration of 3 months starting from June 2023. I have also served as a research intern  at Basira Labs under the supervision of Dr Islem Rekik (Imperial College London) on a research problem at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.

I love exploring new domains in machine learning research and am always up for collaborations.

When I am not coding you can find me playing football or enjoying a good non-fiction book. I love watching Manchester City play and follow their games religiously.
