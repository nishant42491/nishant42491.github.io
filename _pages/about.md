About Me
======
I am a machine learning engineer currently pursuing my bachelors degree in computer science and engineering from K.J Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai.

My current research interests lie in the field of geometric deep learning. I have significant research experience in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I had previously interned at Mettler Toledo for a duration of 6 months where I implemented novel NLP algorithms and models like Microsoft's Layoutlmv2 to help automate the different workflows present at the company. Currently I am serving as a research assistant at K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering where I am working on integrating remote sensing applications with deep learning technology.

I love exploring new domains in machine learning research and am always up for collaborations.

When I am not coding you can find me playing football or enjoying a good non-fiction book. I love watching Manchester City play and follow thier games religiously.
