Hey there ðŸ‘‹. I am an undergraduate researcher pursuing a B.Tech Degree in Computer Engineering from K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai.

My research interest lies in the field of deep probablistic generative modelling and its applications in computer vision. I am also interested in learning about geometric data processing and using geometric objects to enhance generative models.
